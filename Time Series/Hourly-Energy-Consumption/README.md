## PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data
PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) is a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The hourly power consumption data comes from PJM's website and are in megawatts (MW).

The regions have changed over the years so data may only appear for certain dates per region.

## Project Highlights
**Feature Engineering:** Time-based features (like hour, day, and month) are created to capture seasonal and daily trends.

**Machine Learning Model:** XGBoost Regressor is used for predicting future energy consumption values.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score are used to evaluate model performance.

**Data Visualization:** Boxplots, time series decomposition, and other plots are generated to illustrate data patterns.
